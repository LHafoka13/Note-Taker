# Note-Taker

# Function

This app allows End Users to keep track of notes. You will need a title and description for the note in order to initialize it being saved, but once saved, the note will appear on the left side of the screen.

Note: There is a delete button for historically saved notes; however, this does not function currently in this deployment. You also are unable to recall data to the screen when clicked on. 

# Deployment

This app is deployed on Heroku at the following link: <a href="https://polar-depths-60937.herokuapp.com/">Note Taker App</a>

# Challenges 

Some challenges I faced when building the app were largely the structuring of the files in order to get my CSS to persist, and when deploying to Heroku. Now I have a better understanding of why things need to be placed where they are.
